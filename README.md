# My Web Portfolio

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for my web portfolio, showcasing my projects and skills in design and web development. The primary goal of this portfolio is to display my work and demonstrate my capabilities as a designer.

## Development Process

Here is an overview of my process:

1. **Planning:**
   - I wanted my portfolio to reflect me
   -  Researched and gathered design references to create an attractive and functional layout.

2. **Design and Prototyping:**
   - Created wireframes and prototypes in Figma to structure the layout and navigation.
   - Used design tools such as Adobe Color to define the color palette.

3. **Development:**
   - Implemented the layout using HTML and CSS, and styled with Bootstrap for a responsive design.

4. **Testing and Refinements:**
   - Tested the portfolio on different devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
   - Made adjustments.

## Challenges and Solutions

During development, I faced several challenges:

- **Challenge:** Ensuring the portfolio was responsive and worked well on different devices.
  - **Solution:** Used Bootstrap to create a responsive layout and tested the portfolio on various screen sizes.

- **Challenge:** Name the files and paths of the pages appropriately
  - **Solution:** test and detect that some pages were not working, and then carry out the correction
